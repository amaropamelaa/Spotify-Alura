Hello there, 

This repository aims to demonstrate a project performed during an intensive week of front-end learning provided by Alura. 
This project is a Spotify web page, that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks. 
Please, feel free to reach out about this project or use this for your studies. 

Regards,
